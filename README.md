## Tech notes

### CUBE CSS Methodology

**CUBE CSS** is a CSS methodology emphasizing simplicity, pragmatism, and consistency. It focuses on working with the browser's capabilities rather than imposing strict, micro-managed rules. The name CUBE is an acronym for Composition, Utility, Block, and Exception, which represent the different layers of the methodology.

Key aspects of CUBE CSS:

**Composition**:
This layer focuses on creating flexible, component-agnostic layout systems. It uses high-level CSS rules to suggest layout behavior to the browser, allowing it to adapt based on content and context.

**Utility:**
Utility classes provide single, specific CSS properties or values, offering a highly reusable and efficient way to apply styles.

**Block**:
This refers to the core components or modules of a design, encapsulating their specific styles and functionality.

**Exception**:
This layer handles specific deviations or overrides that are necessary for unique cases, ensuring that the general rules are maintained while allowing for flexibility.

### In essence, CUBE CSS promotes:

**Leveraging the cascade and inheritance**:
It encourages using the natural flow of CSS to your advantage, starting with general styles on elements like the body and allowing them to cascade down.

Flexible and adaptable layouts:
The composition layer prioritizes flexible layouts that can accommodate various content arrangements without breaking.

**Reusability and maintainability**:
Utility and block layers promote the creation of reusable components and styles, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.

**Working with the browser**:
Instead of fighting against the browser's default behaviors, CUBE CSS aims to work with them, hinting at desired outcomes rather than rigidly controlling every aspect.

### Browser **"Baseline"**: a standard for web feature support

#### What is Baseline?

"**Baseline**" is an initiative that aims to clarify and standardize browser support information for web platform features. Launched by Google in 2023, it has evolved into a collaborative project maintained by the W3C Web Developer Experience (WebDX) Community Group, web-platform-dx.github.io which includes representatives from major browser vendors like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge.

Before Baseline, determining if a web feature was safe to use was challenging. Developers often had to consult multiple sources, such as Can I Use and browser documentation. Baseline aims to provide a definitive status, making it easier for developers to decide when to implement new features.

### How Baseline works

Baseline categorizes web features based on their availability across a "core browser set" that represents the majority of internet users. This core set includes the two most recent major versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari.

Baseline uses three primary statuses to indicate browser support levels:

- **Limited Availability**: The feature is not yet available across all core browsers.

- **Newly Available**: The feature is supported by all core browsers, signifying interoperability.

- **Widely Available**: The feature has been stable for at least 30 months (approximately 2.5 years) and is considered safe for production use.

- **Discouraged**: (Added in December 2024) Applies to features that developers should no longer use, even if supported in some browsers.

Developers can find Baseline statuses on resources like web.dev, MDN Web Docs, and Can I Use. RUMvision is also working on integrating Baseline information with its real user monitoring (RUM) data.

### Importance of Baseline

Baseline offers several benefits to developers and product owners:

- **Clarity**: Provides a clear understanding of which features are ready for use.

- **Standardization**: Offers a consistent measure for new and existing web features across browsers.

- **Reduced guesswork**: Helps avoid compatibility issues and unexpected behavior across different browsers and devices.

- **Future-proofing**: Enables informed decisions about adopting new features, ensuring websites and web apps function seamlessly for users.

In essence, Baseline simplifies the complex world of browser compatibility, empowering developers and product owners to build more reliable and user-friendly web experiences.

### Fantasy level systems: gaining power and progression

In fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) and narratives, character progression is often represented through a level system. This system quantifies a character's accumulated experience and progress, allowing them to grow stronger, acquire new abilities, and overcome increasingly difficult challenges.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements involved in fantasy level systems:

1. **Experience points (XP)**
   XP is awarded for completing objectives, overcoming obstacles, defeating enemies, and successful role-playing.
   The amount of XP required for each subsequent level usually increases, making higher levels more challenging and rewarding to attain.
   Different activities can yield different amounts of XP. For example, in D&D, killing a powerful monster might grant more XP than picking a lock.

2. **Leveling up**
   When a character accumulates a sufficient amount of XP, they "level up".
   This signifies a significant step in their journey, often marked by fanfare and rewards.
   Leveling up increases character statistics, such as health points, strength, intelligence, and more.
   New abilities, spells, feats, or access to higher-tier equipment may also be unlocked or improved.

3. **Benefits of level systems**
   Sense of Achievement: Leveling up provides a feeling of progress and accomplishment, acknowledging the player's efforts.
   The Hero's Journey: Levels serve as a tangible marker of a character's growth and journey from novice to master.
   Content Control: Game developers can use level systems to introduce new mechanics, challenges, and content gradually, preventing players from being overwhelmed and guiding them through the world.
   Encourages Exploration and Challenge: Players are motivated to seek out more challenging enemies and quests to gain XP and level up faster, according to howtomakeanrpg.

4. **Alternative progression systems**
   While level-based systems are prevalent, other approaches exist, particularly in tabletop RPGs. These include:
   Skill-based systems: Characters improve specific skills through practice and use, rather than by gaining general levels, says an RPGnet Forums user.
   Point-based systems: Experience or advancement points are spent to purchase new abilities or improve existing ones, notes Wikipedia.

   Narrative or milestone progression: Characters level up or gain abilities upon achieving significant milestones in the story or campaign, often at the Dungeon Master's discretion.
   Regardless of the specific implementation, fantasy level systems are a powerful tool for representing character progression, engaging players, and adding structure to the narrative. They provide a clear framework for measuring a character's growth and impact on the fantastical world around them.

### Fantasy level tier and color systems

In fantasy role-playing games and narratives, level tiers are often used to define a character's power level and progression through the game or story. These tiers can be further categorized with colors to visually represent rarity, importance, or overall strength, especially in item rarity or power tiers in video games.
Here's a look at common fantasy level tiers and how colors are used in connection:

Common level tiers in fantasy RPGs and narratives

**Novice/Beginner (Levels 1-4**): At this stage, characters are just starting their journey, learning the basic mechanics of combat and their abilities. They're typically focused on local threats and developing fundamental skills.

**Adept/Journeyman (Levels 5-10)**: Characters have a solid grasp of their class abilities and are capable of tackling more significant challenges. They might be recognized within their local region as competent adventurers and begin engaging with more impactful conflicts.

**Master/Veteran (Levels 11-16)**: Characters are seasoned adventurers, highly skilled in their chosen path. They might have access to powerful spells and abilities, making a noticeable difference in large-scale conflicts, perhaps influencing entire realms.

**Legend/Grandmaster (Levels 17+)**: At this pinnacle of power, characters are truly legendary figures, wielding incredible abilities and capable of impacting the fate of the world or even planar travel.

#### Color-coded tier systems

Color-coded tiers are primarily associated with the rarity and quality of items within games, but can also be used to indicate character power or difficulty level in some cases.

Here are common examples of color tiers for item rarity:

**Grey/White**: Common/Poor: These items are readily available, often having minimal enchantments or low stats.

**Green: Uncommon**: These items are slightly better than common, offering minor stat boosts or small bonuses.

**Blue: Rare:** These items are more difficult to find and offer more significant enchantments or stats.

**Purple: Epic**: These are powerful items with substantial bonuses, often featuring unique abilities or set bonuses.

**Orange/Gold**: Legendary: These items are exceptionally rare and potent, typically boasting unique properties, powerful enchantments, or lore-significant origins.

#### Applications and nuances

**Difficulty Scaling**: Tier systems allow game designers to create enemies and challenges that scale appropriately with the players' progression, ensuring the game remains engaging and challenging.

**Character Abilities**: Leveling up often grants new skills, spells, or abilities, expanding a character's toolkit and allowing them to engage in more complex and strategic gameplay.

**Story Progression**: Level tiers can be integrated into the narrative structure, with different tiers representing distinct arcs or phases of the character's journey.

**Rarity and Value**: Color-coding helps players quickly identify the relative rarity and value of items, influencing their inventory management and strategic decisions.

**Flexibility and Customization**: While there are common patterns, game designers and storytellers have the flexibility to customize their level tier and color systems to fit the specific needs and tone of their fantasy world.

By combining level tiers with color-coded rarity systems, fantasy creators can create a clear and engaging framework for character progression, item acquisition, and overall worldbuilding. According to a Reddit user, these systems can help establish a noticeable difference in how a character experiences the fantasy world around them.

### fantasy weather system

Fantasy weather systems: more than just rain
Weather is a crucial element in fantasy worldbuilding, impacting everything from the mood of a scene to the challenges faced by characters. Beyond simply mimicking real-world weather patterns, fantasy settings often incorporate unique or exaggerated weather phenomena, magical influences, and even weather-related events that drive the plot forward.
Here's how weather can be a dynamic and engaging aspect of a fantasy world:

1. **Setting the mood and tone**
   Weather can dramatically influence the atmosphere of a fantasy setting. Rain can evoke sadness or renewal, while sunshine suggests happiness and hope. Snow might represent purity or isolation, and fog can create a sense of mystery or danger.

2. **Driving the plot**
   Weather can act as an obstacle, forcing characters to adapt. It can also be a catalyst for change, leading to difficult decisions or unforeseen plot twists. For example, the tornado in "The Wizard of Oz" transports Dorothy to a magical realm. Additionally, weather can be used symbolically to mirror character transformations or significant plot developments.
3. **Unique and magical weather phenomena**
   Fantasy worlds can feature weather beyond the ordinary, such as raining fish or wine, supernatural fog, or deafening gales. More unusual examples include "Sparkle," tiny glittering lights in the sky, "Blue Rain" that shrouds the night in darkness, or "Reverse Rain" that moves upwards. Other fantastical phenomena include "Ghost Fog," which increases paranormal activity, and "Anti-Magic Storms" that dispel enchantments. Some settings might even include events like "Chitinous High," where insects grow to enormous size.

4. **Magical manipulation**
   Powerful mages or deities can control or create weather for various purposes, such as summoning storms for battle or creating favorable conditions for travel. They can manipulate existing phenomena, like controlling clouds to bring rain, or create entirely new effects, such as lightning from a clear sky. The most powerful users can influence weather on a large scale, impacting entire ecosystems.

5. **Integrating weather into gameplay**
   In game settings, weather can introduce penalties or bonuses to actions like ranged attacks, perception, or movement. Characters may need to interact with the environment by seeking shelter or adapting to conditions like floods. Weather can also enhance encounters, with fog obscuring sight or wind affecting ranged attacks.
   By incorporating weather thoughtfully, creators can add realism and immersion to their fantasy worlds, making the environment an active part of the narrative.

### fantasy day and night system

Fantasy day and night systems: more than just light and dark
In fantasy worlds, the cycle of day and night can be far more than just a transition between light and dark. It can influence magic, shape landscapes, affect creatures, and even drive the narrative forward.

Here's a look at how fantasy creators can design engaging day and night systems:

1. **Astronomical and temporal variations**
   **Non-Earthlike Cycles**: Instead of a standard 24-hour cycle, a fantasy world could have days and nights of different lengths, varying with the seasons or other celestial events.
   **Multiple Suns or Moons**: A world with multiple suns could have constant daylight, or alternating periods of brightness depending on the suns' positions. Multiple moons can create intricate phases and affect tides and magic.
   **Irregular Cycles**: The length of day and night could be unpredictable, driven by magical forces, the whims of deities, or the cyclical movement of celestial objects. For instance, a world without a sun might rely on a magical lamp for light, with the day/night cycle fluctuating based on the lamp's fuel source.

2. **Magical influences**
   **Day/Night-Specific Magic**: Certain types of magic might be stronger or weaker during the day or night. Day magic could focus on light, heat, and fire, while night magic might involve shadows, darkness, or illusions.
   Magical Creatures: Some creatures might only appear at night, while others are more active during the day. For example, daemons in Final Fantasy XV appear at night, driving players to seek shelter or camp.
   Lunar Phases and Magic: The phases of the moon could influence magic users or certain types of spells. Full moon magic, for example, is often depicted as the most potent for any purpose.

3. **Environmental and societal impacts**
   **Architecture and Infrastructure**: Cities and buildings could be designed to adapt to varying light conditions, perhaps with bioluminescent structures for nighttime illumination.

   **Social Rhythms:** The daily routines of people and societies could be shaped by the day/night cycle, impacting everything from work schedules and festivals to social interactions.

   **Unique Phenomena**: Night could bring with it strange or magical weather patterns, like ghost fog that increases paranormal activity, or anti-magic storms that suppress magical effects. Final Fantasy XV features a spreading darkness called the Starscourge that lengthens nights, illustrating the significant impact a day/night system can have on a world.
   By considering these aspects, fantasy creators can craft a day and night system that not only adds depth to their world but also generates compelling narrative opportunities and gameplay mechanics. The key is to think beyond a simple 24-hour cycle and explore how a unique day and night system can impact every facet of the fantasy setting.

### Fantasy weapon systems

A well-developed fantasy weapon system goes beyond simply listing swords and axes. It defines how weapons interact with the world, its creatures, its magic, and the characters who wield them. Here are key components to consider when crafting a compelling fantasy weapon system:

1.  **Weapon types and categories**
    Fantasy worlds, especially those designed for role-playing games, categorize weapons based on various characteristics:

    - **Melee Weapons**: Designed for close-quarters combat, emphasizing strength, dexterity, and potentially strategy. Examples include swords, axes, maces, daggers, spears, and hammers.
    - **Ranged Weapons**: Allow attacks from a distance, offering tactical advantages. Examples include bows, crossbows, slings, and throwing weapons like shurikens.

    - **Magical Weapons**: Infused with arcane power to deal enhanced damage or provide special effects. These can be enchanted blades, staves that channel spells, or artifacts of immense magical potential.

    - **Projectile Weapons**: Include anything thrown or launched, adding versatility to combat. This can overlap with ranged weapons, but might also include things like bombs or javelins.

    - **Unconventional Weapons**: Creative or unique weapons that defy traditional categories, like musical instruments used by bards, books wielded by scholars, or even gunblades.

2.  **Weapon materials and crafting**
    The materials used to craft weapons can significantly impact their properties and significance within the world:

         - **Mundane Materials:** Wood, stone, bronze, iron, and steel are common materials for basic weaponry in many fantasy settings.

         - **Fantastic Materials**: Fantasy often introduces unique materials with special properties, like Mithral (light and strong like silver, favored by elves), Adamantine (extremely hard, possibly indestructible), Orichalcum (channels and blocks magic), and Tenebrium (a spiritual poison found in evil realms).

         - **Forging and Craftsmanship**: The source of weapons can be important. Certain forges might have unique techniques or materials, and some might even be imbued with magic or have legendary histories.

3.  **Magical properties and enchantments**

    - **Magical weapons can possess a wide range of enchantments that affect combat and gameplay**:
    - **Elemental Damage**: Weapons might deal fire, ice, lightning, or other elemental damage on hit.

    - **Status Effects**: Enchantments could inflict poison, stun enemies, or drain life force.

    - **Special Abilities**: Weapons can grant unique abilities like flight, enhanced stealth, teleportation, or even the ability to bypass certain defenses.

    - **Sentience**: Some weapons in fantasy lore are sentient, possessing their own minds, personalities, and sometimes a dark history.

4.  **Weapon proficiency and character classes**

    - **Proficiency**: Characters typically need training or proficiency to use certain weapons effectively. This can be based on their race, class, or acquired through feats.

    - **Class Restrictions**: Different character classes might be limited to specific weapon categories that complement their fighting style. For example, paladins might favor longswords and shields, while rogues might use daggers.

    - **Penalties for Lack of Proficiency**: Using a weapon without proficiency can result in penalties to attack rolls or damage, reflecting the character's unfamiliarity with the weapon.

5.  **Balancing and design considerations**

    - **Balance**: Ensure weapons are balanced in terms of power and utility, preventing some weapons from becoming too dominant or underpowered.

    - **Integration with Worldbuilding**: Align weapon types, materials, and magical properties with the setting's lore, geography, and culture.

    - **Environmental Needs**: Consider how the environment might impact weapon effectiveness. For example, large weapons might be impractical in dense jungles, while ranged weapons might be less effective against swarms of small enemies.

    - **Character Motivation**: The choice of weapon can reveal aspects of a character's background, fighting style, and moral alignment.

By carefully considering these elements, fantasy creators can build a robust and engaging weapon system that enhances the depth and realism of their world while providing exciting and strategic combat opportunities.

Fantasy turn-based game mechanics
Fantasy turn-based games combine strategic combat with rich narratives and character development, often inspired by tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. Here are some core mechanics often found in this genre:

1. Core turn-based combat
   Sequential Turns: Players and AI opponents take turns acting in a specific order.
   Menu-Based Actions: During a turn, players typically select actions from a menu, such as attacking, using skills, casting spells, or using items.
   Strategic Planning: The turn-based nature allows players to carefully consider their moves and plan out their strategy without time pressure, unlike real-time games.
   Examples: Popular examples include the main series Pokémon games, Persona/Shin Megami Tensei, and Dragon Quest.
2. Character and party management
   Classes and Roles: Characters typically belong to different classes (e.g., warrior, mage, rogue) with distinct abilities and roles in combat.
   Stats and Progression: Characters have numerical stats (strength, intelligence, agility, etc.) that determine their effectiveness in battle and can be improved through experience points and leveling up.
   Gear and Inventory: Players manage equipment (weapons, armor) and items (potions, scrolls) that can impact character stats and provide temporary buffs or healing.
   Party Composition: Tactical RPGs often involve commanding a party of multiple characters, requiring players to consider their strengths, weaknesses, and how they complement each other in combat.
3. Advanced combat mechanics
   Grid-Based Movement: Tactical RPGs often use a grid or tile-based map for movement and positioning, adding another layer of strategy to battles.
   Elementals and Weaknesses: Many fantasy settings incorporate elemental magic systems where characters and enemies have strengths and weaknesses to different elements (fire, ice, etc.).
   Status Effects: Abilities and spells can inflict or remove various status effects (poison, stun, buff, debuff), influencing character performance or limiting actions.
   Action Points: Some games use an Action Point system, where each action (movement, attack, spell) consumes a certain number of points, allowing for more granular control over turns according to Reddit.
   Combos and Synergies: Players can often combine different abilities or units to unleash powerful combo attacks or synergistic strategies, adding depth and a puzzle-like element to gameplay.
   Conditional Turn-Based (CTB): Instead of a fixed turn order, some games like Final Fantasy X use a CTB system where actions have a weight, and quicker actions allow for more frequent turns.
4. Narrative and exploration
   Story-Driven Gameplay: Most fantasy turn-based RPGs have a strong narrative with a main storyline and side quests.
   World Exploration: Players explore a game world, interact with NPCs, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets.
   Choices and Consequences: Player choices can influence the story's progression and lead to different outcomes.
   Note: This is a general overview, and different games within the fantasy turn-based genre may implement these mechanics in varying ways and incorporate unique twists to make their systems stand out
